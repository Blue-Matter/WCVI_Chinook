# Methods

The objectives of the case study are to:

1. Develop an operating model in salmonMSE that incorporates life history variability in hatchery release strategies & natural-origin life cycle groups

2. Develop alternative scenarios to compare outcomes with various habitat and hatchery options

3. Develop performance measures and visualization tools to facilitate comparison of various scenarios

## salmonMSE operating model {#sec:om}

The operating model is stochastic and age-structured. Individual scenarios are projected forward in time from a specified starting abundance.

The configuration of the operating model is presented below and organized by life cycle.
Sources for the parameters include the CTC exploitation rate model, Brown et al. Res Doc, as well as the exploitation rate models fitted to various CWT datasets (Appendices \@ref(app:sarita-cwt) and \@ref(app:quinsam-cwt)).

The description below represents the base model, from which subsequent alterations are made.
One hundred simulations were used per scenario, with a projection period of 50 years. 

### Spawners

The egg production is calculated from the number of natural origin and hatchery origin spawners. Fecundity is age-specific with fecundity of 3000 at age 3, 3600 at age 4, 4600 at age 5 (Brown et al.).

No fish are mature at age 1.

The fecundity at age 2 was set to half of the value of age 3. Most if not all age 2 spawners are precocious males. 
These spawners can ensure genetic diversity by breeding across brood years. 
Since this is not a sex-specific model, some assumption of fecundity value is needed in order to carry over breeding success for age 2 spawners. Calculations involving spawner composition, including pWILD, PNI, and pHOS are weighted by age class fecundity.

It is assumed that 40 percent of spawners are female at all age classes (life cycle model, Table 3.3 of Brown et al.).

**Note it is possible to adjust fecundity and proportion females by age class. According to Brown et al. page 24: The average percent of WCVI Chinook spawners that are female at each age is <1% at age two (called ‘jills’—i.e. female jacks), 10% female at age 3, 55% female at age 4, and 80% female at ages 5–7. These averages are based mostly on Robertson Creek Hatchery broodstock and Stamp River deadpitch sampling, but appear to be indicative of most WCVI Chinook populations.**

A typical value of 0.8 was used for the relative reproductive success of hatchery spawners (Withler et al.).

### Natural production of juveniles

Egg-fry survival in the natural environment is modeled as a stochastic density-independent parameter, informed by an environment relationship where the fry/adult is predicted from the previous autumn (Figure \@ref(fig:env)).

For the projection, average historical conditions during 2017--2023 were assumed, corresponding to 60% of days when the mean daily discharge exceeded 5 cubic meters per second. The fry/spawner values were then simulated from a lognormal distribution with the mean and standard deviation obtained in Figure \@ref(fig:env).

The egg-fry survival is converted from fry/spawner assuming an average fecundity of 3900 and a proportion female of 0.4 (Figure \@ref(fig:fry-surv)).

The resulting fry are then divided by life cycle group, which will have different survival rates at age 1 after outmigration (described in Section \@ref(sec:marine-life-stage)). 
95 percent of the fry as assigned as early-smalls and the rest are late-larges.

### Hatchery production of juveniles

Target hatchery releases, by release strategy, are specified by the user. Here, the releases in 2023 with 292,853 fed fry and 288,745 traditionals were used as the annual target. Release strategies differ in maturity rates, described in Section \@ref(sec:maturity).

The mark rate is assumed to be 1.

The mortality rate is 10 percent shortly after release, and releases immediately enter the marine life stage.

### Marine life stage and preterminal fishery {#sec:marine-life-stage}

The juvenile marine life stage is represented in the model through a matrix through semestral age and time (2 semesters equals one year). 

In the first half of the year, juveniles are vulnerable to the preterminal fishery. 
The relative vulnerability by age class was stochastically sampled from the posterior distribution in the Sarita exploitation rate model (Appendix \@ref(app:sarita-cwt)) and assumed to be identical for all release strategies and life cycle groups (Figure \@ref(fig:mat-vul)).
A constant, annual harvest rate of 0.35 was used (life cycle model, Table 3.3 of Brown et al.).

In the second half of the year, mature fish are removed from the juvenile abundance matrix, and the remaining juveniles experience natural mortality. 

The natural survival at age 1 natural mortality from obtained from the life cycle model (Table 3.3 of Brown et al.), with 96.9% mortality for both hatchery release strategies. For natural origin fish, age-1 natural mortality is 99.6% for early smalls and 95% for late larges. 

For older fish, the natural mortality is 30% at age 2, 20% at age 3, 10% at age 4 and older, as assumed in the CTC exploitation rate model.

### Maturity and terminal exploitation {#sec:maturity}

CWT escapement indicates that traditionals mature earlier compared to fed fry.
However, the Robertson Creek indicator stock comprises of only traditionals.
Therefore, the approach was to estimate maturity of fed fry and traditionals from the Quinsam (northern Strait of Georgia) stock, and apply the ratio of differences to the Robertson traditionals to arrive at a hypothesized maturity function for Sarita fed fry (Appendix \@ref(app:quinsam-cwt)).

In the CWT exploitation rate model, maturity is estimated for each brood year. 
For the operating model, the maturity was stochastically sampled from the posterior and averaged across the most recent 6 complete brood years (2013--2018, Figure \@ref(fig:mat-vul)).

It is assumed that both natural-origin life cycle groups have the maturity function of fed fry.

The age structure of the return is represented separately from the juveniles. 
The return are only present in the second half of the year and are vulnerable to the terminal fishery.

The relative vulnerability by age class was stochastically sampled from the posterior distribution in the Sarita exploitation rate model (Appendix \@ref(app:sarita-cwt)) and assumed to be identical for all release strategies and life cycle groups (Figure \@ref(fig:mat-vul)).
A constant, annual harvest rate of 0.05 was used (life cycle model, Table 3.3 of Brown et al.) with mark-selective fishing following ESSR practices.

The simplest assumption of no release mortality was used. Therefore, the 0.05 terminal exploitation rate applies to hatchery-origin fish. Natural-origin fish experience no additional mortality.

```

#### Escapement and broodtake

After the terminal fishery, the escapement is represented in a third matrix.
Each year, an additional 100 hatchery strays return (all age 5).
Additional mortality can be applied en-route to spawning grounds and the hatchery, but currently en-route survival is one.

The escapement is then reduced by broodtake to arrive at the number of spawners.
100 percent of the total escapement can be used as broodtake. 

75 percent of the hatchery escapement return to the hatchery, i.e., removed from the spawning component and available as broodtake, and the remaining 25 percent are spawners.

The broodtake is calculated as the number of spawners required to achieve the target egg production (target releases divided by 85 percent broodtake survival in the hatchery). 

The ratio of unmarked and marked broodtake matches the target pNOB set to 0.11 (M. Thom, pers. comm. via AHA spreadsheets). 

The age proportions of the broodtake is proportional to the underlying escapement.

No fitness parameters are currently modeled but can be informed by Withler et al.

## Scenarios

Five scenarios were included in the June 2nd presentation:

1. Base scenario, as described in Section \@ref(sec:om)
2. 90% Fed Fry – 10% Traditionals, instead of 50-50% in the base
3. 10% Fed Fry – 90% Traditionals
4. High fry/spawner (wet autumns). Assume mean environmental variable of 80% days in October with high daily discharge (compared to 60%)
5. High pNOB target = 0.5 (compared to 0.11)
